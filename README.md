# How to Get Unbanned on Blade & Soul (2025 Guide) ⚔️

Getting banned from Blade & Soul can feel like a brutal kick from a Jin Seo-Yeon combo — especially if you swear it was a mistake! This easy-to-follow guide will help you figure out why you got banned and how to appeal like a pro to get your account back in the game.

## Maybe You Are HWID Banned? 🖥️

Did your ban follow you even after you made a shiny new account? Or were you banned literally the moment you logged in? There’s a good chance you’ve got an **HWID ban** (Hardware ID Ban)! Blade & Soul flags your PC hardware, so even new accounts can’t escape the ban hammer.

If this sounds like you, using an HWID spoofer might be your ticket back to the martial arts mayhem.

## Step 1: Understand Why You Were Banned ❓

Check your emails or Blade & Soul notifications to find out the official reason. Common ban triggers include:
- Cheating, bots, or third-party hacks
- Toxic chat, trolling, or harassing fellow players
- Account sharing or suspicious login patterns

**Pro tip:** Always give the Blade & Soul Terms of Service a quick scan before sending that appeal.
